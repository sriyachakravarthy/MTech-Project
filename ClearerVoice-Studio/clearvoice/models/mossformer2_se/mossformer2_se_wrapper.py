    Arguments
    ---------
    args : Namespace
        Configuration arguments that may include hyperparameters 
        and model settings (not utilized in this implementation but 
        can be extended for flexibility).

    Example
    ---------
    >>> model = MossFormer2_SE_48K(args).model
    >>> x = torch.randn(10, 180, 2000)  # Example input
    >>> outputs, mask = model(x)  # Forward pass
