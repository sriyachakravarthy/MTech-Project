# ClearerVoice-Studio: Train Speech Enhancement Models

## 1. Introduction

This repository provides training scripts for speech enhancement models. Currently, it supports fresh train or finetune for the following models:

|model name| sampling rate | Paper Link|
|----------|---------------|------------|
|FRCRN_SE_16K|16000        | FRCRN ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07293), ICASSP 2022)   |
|MossFormerGAN_SE_16K|16000| MossFormer2 Backbone + GAN ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11825), ICASSP 2024)|
|MossFormer2_SE_48K  |48000| MossFormer2 Backbone + Masking ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11825), ICASSP 2024)|

1. **FRCRN_SE_16K**

FRCRN uses a complex network for single-channel speech enhancement. It is a generalized method for enhancing speech in various noise environments. Our trained FRCRN model has won good performance in IEEE ICASSP 2022 DNS Challenge. Please check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07293). 

The FRCRN model is developed based on a new framework of **Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (CRED)**, which is built on the Convolutional Encoder-Decoder (CED) architecture. CRED can significantly improve the performance of the convolution kernel by improving the limited receptive fields in the convolutions of CED using frequency recurrent layers. In addition, we introduce the Complex Feedforward Sequential Memory Network (CFSMN) to reduce the complexity of the recurrent network, and apply complex-valued network operations to realize the full complex deep model, which not only constructs long sequence speech more effectively, but also can enhance the amplitude and phase of speech at the same time.

2. **MossFormerGAN_SE_16K**

MossFormerGAN is motivated from [CMGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15149) and [TF-GridNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03952). We use an extended MossFormer2 backbone (See below figure) to replace Conformer in CMGAN and add the Full-band Self-attention Modul proposed in TF-GridNet. The whole speech enhancemnt network is optimized by the adversarial training scheme as described in CMGAN. We extended the CNN network to an attention-based network for the discriminator. MossFormerGAN is trained for 16kHz speech enhancement.

3. **MossFormer2_SE_48K**

`MossFormer2_SE_48K` is a full-band (48kHz) speech enhancement model. Full-band 48 kHz speech enhancement is becoming increasingly important due to advancements in communication platforms and high-quality media consumption. Several open-sourced github repos such as [FullSubNet](https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/FullSubNet), [DeepFilterNet](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet), and [resemble-enhance](https://github.com/resemble-ai/resemble-enhance) have released pre-trained models. We provide a more competitive `MossFormer2_SE_48K` model in our [ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice) and the training and finetune scripts here.

`MossFormer2_SE_48K` uses the following model architecture. It uses noisy fbank as input to predict the [Phase-Sensitive Mask (PSM)](https://www.jonathanleroux.org/pdf/Erdogan2015ICASSP04.pdf). Then, the predicted mask is applied to the noisy STFT spectrogram. Finally, the estimated STFT spectrogram is converted back to waveform by IFFT. The main component is the MossFormer2 block which consists of a MossFormer module and a Recurrent model. The number of MossFormer2 blocks can be adjusted to deepen the network. We used 24 MossFormer2 blocks in `MossFormer2_SE_48K`.

We provided performance comparisons of our released models with the publically available models in [ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice) page.

## 2. Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide

If you haven't created a Conda environment for ClearerVoice-Studio yet, follow steps 1 and 2. Otherwise, skip directly to step 3.

1. **Clone the Repository**

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio.git
```

2. **Create Conda Environment**

``` sh
cd ClearerVoice-Studio
conda create -n ClearerVoice-Studio python=3.8
conda activate ClearerVoice-Studio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Notice: Other higher python versions such as python 3.12.1 should also be supported.

3. **Prepare Dataset**
   
If you don't have any training dataset to start with, we recommend you to download the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset ([link](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2826)]. You may store the dataset anywhere. What you need to start the model training is to create two scp files as shown in `data/tr_demand_28_spks_16k.scp` and `data/cv_demand_testset_16k.scp`. `data/tr_demand_28_spks_16k.scp` contains the training data list and `data/cv_demand_testset_16k.scp` contains the testing data list.

Replace `data/tr_demand_28_spks_16k.scp` and `data/cv_demand_testset_16k.scp` with your new .scp files in `config/train/*.yaml`. Now it is ready to train the models.

4. **Start Training**

``` sh
bash train.sh
```

You may need to set the correct network in `train.sh` and choose either a fresh training or a finetune process using:
```
network=MossFormer2_SE_48K            #Train MossFormer2_SE_48K model
train_from_last_checkpoint=1          #Set 1 to start training from the last checkpoint if exists, 
init_checkpoint_path=./               #Path to your initial model if starting fine-tuning; otherwise, set it to 'None'
```
